# Leukemia Classification Project

This project is a deep learning-based application for leukemia classification using microscopic images. The system detects and classifies cells as "HEM" (normal) or "ALL" (leukemia) with high accuracy, based on EfficientNetV2.

## üåü Features
- **Image Prediction**: Upload cell images to classify them as leukemia or normal.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays the confidence level of the prediction.
- **Interactive UI**: A simple, user-friendly web interface built with Flask.
- **Advanced Deep Learning**: Utilizes TensorFlow and pre-trained EfficientNetV2 for image classification.
